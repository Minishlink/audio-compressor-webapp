# Audio compressor web app
> Compress your dialogue audio files locally on your browser

This ~3hr project is a simple demo of using FFmpeg in the browser,
while serving a practical purpose of compressing dialogue audio files.

The application allows users to select audio files and process the files using FFmpeg in the browser.
The result is a compressed audio file that retains the quality of the original, but with smaller file size, making it easier to store and share.

It is important to note that music files are not suitable for this type of compression as it may result in loss of quality.
The compression applied is optimized for dialogue audio and may not provide the desired results for music files.
